# mirrorPut Utility
This utility was developed by [ATA Engineering](http://www.ata-e.com) to use
with the put files generated by Loci/CHEM. This can be useful when attempting
to restart a full model from a half model. The put file from the half model
can be mirrored, and the resulting file can be used to initialize the full 
model. Currently the utility only supports mirroring about the x=0, y=0, or
z=0 planes.

# Dependencies
This python utility requires the h5py and argparse libraries.

# Usage
Detailed usage can be found by passing the script the **-h** or **--help** 
options. The put file to mirror and the plane to mirror about can be specified 
on the command line.

```
mirrorPut -h
```
```
mirrorPut -f put.0_myCase -p z
```
